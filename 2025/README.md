## Day 01

I ended up relying too much on icub3d's [solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbHga6A608), essentially just copying it for the first day.

I overall like the coding style, so I will try to lean on this type of coding style for the remaining days,
but only look to his and others' solutions once I have solved the puzzle.

I got annoyed with where I got stuck today, but that is just a bad excuse.

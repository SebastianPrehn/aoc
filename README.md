# Advent of Code

My repository for solutions to the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
I will try to allocate time to create solutions for each day, but may
not be able to complete each puzzle daily. I am not competing for any
fancy scores, but will generally try to write good code. If you see
any bad practices, then feel free to reach out and mention those to me.

My ambitions for each year are:
- Attempt to solve the puzzle the day it is posted.
- Use a maximum of 1 hour per day on each puzzle, except on weekends.

These ambitions are meant to keep me grounded, and to make sure that I
do not over-engineer solutions nor waste too much time of my weekdays.

## 2021

My chosen language of 2021 was C#.

I failed to really get into the challenges before the mid of the month,
where my motion to actively try had detoriated significantly.

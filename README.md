# Advent of Code - 2021

Some solutions for [Advent of Code - 2021](https://adventofcode.com/).

I will work on those that I find interesting, amusing, or a good challenge.

I am not taking the "challenge" of gathering stars seriously, nor am
I aiming for any special score.

My current ambitions are:
- Attempt to solve the puzzle the day it is posted.
- Use a maximum of 1 hour per day on each puzzle.
- Use a combination of different languages for the first couple of days, and then stick to one for at least 12 of the days.
  - Rust, C#, Common Lisp and Haskell are those I want to try out the most.
